[<p itemprop="description" lang="en">Amazing food, long wait. \xa0Be prepared to wait at least 2-3 hours at peak times.<br><br>We went on a Saturday around 5 and put our names on the list. \xa0We knew we would be waiting a long time so we were prepared to hang around the area for a while. \xa0I highly recommend the Lone Wolf or Fox Bar while you are waiting. \xa0Both are close and decent places to grab a drink. \xa0Once you get your text that your table is ready make sure to get back quick!<br><br>We were sat at the bar area of the diner (this restaurant is really just an upscale diner) and it was actually pretty cool because we were able to watch all of the food being made right in front of us.<br><br>To start, we split an order of the General Jane's Chicken. \xa0It was fantastic, perfectly crispy and tangy. \xa0It even comes with hot towels to clean off after!<br><br>Next was the Au Cheval staple; the double burger with fried egg and bacon. \xa0Wow. \xa0One of the best burgers I have ever had. \xa0Not much else to say besides that.<br><br>We also ordered the fries as a side for the burgers. \xa0They were also extremely good.<br><br>The atmosphere is really neat and the food is even better. \xa0I will absolutely be back in the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Tip: you better get there early or you're in for a wait. I showed up about 15 minutes early and still ended up being 20th or 30th in line. <br>Food Network and many other claim it as the best in the country. While delish, I wouldn't call it the best. In my option it rates in the top 10 that I've had. <br>I'd go back but not out of my way to eat there.</br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">I've been twice, it's definitely worth the wait! \xa0Toss your name on the list and go either next door to Lone Wolf or kitty corner to Haymarket!<br><br>The first time I went, I got the burger with a fried egg and bacon. \xa0You need to get the bacon. \xa0I have to say, the burger stands up to its reputation. \xa0<br><br>The second time I got the fried chicken. \xa0It was amazing, if you want to try something different definitely get that!</br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">After being turned down 3 times because the wait was absurdly long, I finally got to try Au Cheval. My group made a game plan to get there right around opening, and the strategy worked. <br><br>DO: Get to Au Cheval on a weekday near opening time<br><br>DON'T: Expect to get into Au Cheval any other time ANY day of the week. <br><br>Anyway, the hype was real. A lot of these restaurants are a victim of their own hype, with expectations that are way too pie in the sky. Not so here - the food is pretty damn good.<br><br>My group started off our night with a round of fancy drinks - I ordered the Hemingway Daiquiri and danggg it was tasty. I'll be the first to admit that I love sugary alcohol and was pretty impressed by the flavors. <br><br>We then got some General Jane's chicken, because you should splurge when you're at Au Cheval. You worked hard for it! The chicken was fried to perfection and coated in a deliciously tangy asian sauce. <br><br>For our main course, I got the double cheese burger (three patties!) with an egg and bacon on top. This is what I came for right? I wish I could have captured the food porn moment of the egg getting cut open and making coating my burger in richness. The burger was perfectly cooked. I think the secret to the goodness was the thick cut bacon - they provide two thick slabs that give an extra layer of crunchiness, texture, and complexity. <br><br>We also had a side fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and a farm fresh egg. I'm not sure what Mornay sauce is but the dish was overall no slouch. I wish we had gotten the regular fries but that'll be a visit for another time.<br><br>Overall, the hype is real. Try this place out if you're in Chi town.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">I didn't want to believe the hype; fucking believe it, and then some! Legitimately the best thing I've ever put in my mouth ::all puns intended::<br><br>Their drinks are pretty strong. 12.00 a drink puts you on a run for good money. Hemingway daiquiri had me feeling all kinds of tipsy. The Old Fashioned is good too if you're into stronger drinks. <br><br>Get the classic/single burger. Add an egg and bacon for sure. It's pure sex. Heaven. They won't cook your burger anything less than medium-but it's perfection as is so no complaints here! I can't really even articulate how perfectly seasoned and amazing this shit is you just have to find out for yourself. We added a side of fries-TO DIE! The garlic aoli with the fries was absolutely mouthwatering. By far the best burger meal I've ever had.<br><br>I literally had to request a day off to try this sex dish. The last time we attempted to come here on a saturday(BIG MISTAKE!) it was a 4 hour wait. Came here on a Friday afternoon 1/2 and it was perfect; 40-hour and a half wait. We got seated in 20 min!<br><br>Food was truly Devine! Orgasmic there are just simply no words. Expensive? Yes def. so worth it? Yes def!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Plan to arrive before the restaurant opens and wait patiently because the wait does increase if you come later. Got in on our second attempt for brunch on a Saturday because our party arrived 30 minutes before they opened. Arrived 15 minutes after they opened on our first attempt and the wait was over an hour!<br><br>One of the best burgers I've ever had! Single cheeseburger (the patties are thin and a single is served with two patties, a double has three patties) with a side order of fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and fried farm egg. Don't forget a side order of the thick cut bacon (IT'S A MUST!). The burger comes out open faced with the fried egg on the patty; add bacon, close the burger, and enjoy!<br><br>I'd recommend coming for dinner because the menu is slightly different. I was told that their fried chicken is really good too but they didn't serve it for brunch - bummer! There are other items that looked good too that I hope to try one day. Definitely coming back when I'm back in Chicago!</br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">whoaaa wow. this place will forever be my favorite place to eat at in Chicago. My friend and I decided last minute to dine at au cheval since it was highly recommended by our uber driver. (Thank you uber driver!) Thankfully, we had some time to spare on our last day so we went after lunch time and the place was still busy! The wait wasn't too bad. We were happy to sit at the bar and watch the chefs make their drool worthy dishes. <br><br>We decided to get an order of the single burger with egg and bacon on top and a side of smashed potatoes. THIS WAS DELICIOUS. the smashed potatoes with garlic gravy was amazing. There were pieces of potatoes in each bite and it so good. The burger was the best. the egg was cooked to perfection. The runny egg all over the beef patty and cheese was perfect. this is a simple burger and that's all anyone should really need to taste how amazing it is. <br><br>hands down the best burger I've had. My only regret was not reaching over their counter to take the bottle of dijonnaise sauce. that sauce is crack</br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">WOW AMAZINGGGGGGG - So by now, everyone in the hamburger community must have heard about this place. You will see it on food network from time to time, and on every type of top burger list. So on my recent trip to Chicago I knew I had to come.<br><br>We decided to go on a Sunday for lunch, now they open at 10AM apparently, and we got there at 10:20 or so.... ok 1 hour wait time :( say whattt. When we went inside there were people already eating their burgers at that time hah. Tells you how good this place really is.<br><br>The few drawbacks: 1) this place is really small, 2) very crowded, 3) music is super loud (can't hear yourself).<br><br>But the food, so good, I think it's the best burger I ever had. We each got a buger, with Egg and Bacon. I think like $11 for thr burger, $1.50 for the egg, and like $3.50 for the bacon. I got my burger without any extra stuff. Just meat and cheese, no whatever else came with that (well besides the egg and bacon). But it oooooozed out gooiness. Melts in your mouth. The egg is cooked to perfection and so is the bacon. Two large thick cuts of glorious bacon. Without a doubt, the best bacon I've ever eaten in my life.<br><br>I think this was the best overall burger I've ever had. Also, we got a side of French fries, good enough for 2 people, maybe 3. <br><br>I would wait 2 hours for this place!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">This place definitely serves the best burgers ever. I ordered their single burger which still came with two meat patties. Of course I had to add an egg with bacon to the burger which was amazing. I ordered their fries which came perfectly seasoned with salt and I love the garlic mayo sauce that it came with. As an appetizer my boyfriend and I ordered their chili dip. I'm not a huge fan of foods that have a smokey take to it however my boyfriend loved it. This place was packed from the moment we walked in. Although our burgers took almost an hour to be served, it was definitely worth the wait! I love how their menu is real simple as they don't have much to choose from. I recommend those who are looking for the perfect burger to definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it. I will definitely return here on my next trip to Chicago.</p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">If Morgan Freeman's voice was a juicy, delicious hamburger, it would be made at Au Cheval. <br><br>I went when it opened, so getting a table was a breeze. The place filled up quickly though. I had been to small cheval before, so I was curious to see how the real deal would compare. <br><br>I ordered a burger with bacon and a friend egg as well as the fries. The fries were pretty much the same as small-crispy and good, but the aoli really brought it home. The egg on my burger was cooked perfectly, and the bacon was so thick it was insane. One bite into this burger and I lost all sense of time and space. The burgers are juicy and delicious, complemented nicely by the thick bacon, gooey egg, and perfectly toasted buns. <br><br>I gotta be honest-I don't think it's worth the 2-3 hour waits people endure when you could go to small cheval and get essentially the same thing (for a much shorter wait). But even so, this is hands down the best burger I have ever had.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">We showed up about 30 min before opening for Sunday brunch and were the first in line. We were promptly seated and served! Great service, but it's a small space. I'm a pretty small person and I had to worry about knocking the table next to our over. Yikes.<br><br>A pretty good burger, but definitely not the best burger in the US. Sorry, Bon Appetit.<br><br>Do yourself a favor and add bacon to your burger! It's definitely worth it. Egg? I could've done without. The fries were overly salty. But, they make a mean Bloody Mary.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">HOLY SHIT this burger was AMAZING!! Now go to Au Cheval. <br><br>The wait was 1.5 to 2 hours when Boyfriend and I arrived on Thursday night but I made friends at the bar and they gave us their seats once they were done with their meal, wait time 10 minutes. Go me. I ordered a single cheeseburger with bacon and Boyfriend ordered the same but added egg, remember the single is actually two patties, and we split an order of fries. The bacon on top of the burger was thick and delicious, we devoured our meals. <br><br>For drinks I ordered a Hemingway Daiquiri and was VERY impressed with this cocktail. \xa0<br><br>It was voted the best burger in Illinois for a reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Soooo after all the talk of the BEST burger in Chicago, I have to say I'm not blown away. I must go again, I feel like some how... Some way... I missed out.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, it was a good burger, but I'm not as impressed as I thought. I was with another foodie friend of mine and she agreed. I'm so happy I didn't have to wait longer than 15 minutes for a table, but I gladly would have if my burger lived up to its name. We got the burger that was suggested, maybe next time I will leave off the bacon..<br><br>Say it ain't so. <br><br>The Bloody Mary was phenomenal! The ambiance is great- I'll be back for a second try, with hopefully an undated review</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">THE HYPE. <br><br>THE HYPE IS REAL. <br><br>I didn't have to wait for hours, but even at 2:45pm on a Wednesday, my party of three still had to patiently bide our time for about 15-20 minutes before we were seated. <br><br>The restaurant is small, but it certainly has a cool, adult, vibe to it. It's difficult to describe.<br><br>This was the home of the best burger in Chicago? Hmm...guess I just had to try it. I got a single (which is really a double) with egg and bacon (extra by about $4.50), and a side of fries. <br><br>The burger is truly awesome, easily one of the best I've had in my life. I actually love the bacon, which almost had a sweet taste to it. The egg was a great addition as well, but I'm just a sucker for runny eggs. It was a mess to eat, but it was a GOOD mess. <br><br>Their fries were fine. I didn't really love them or hate them. They came with a nice garlic aioli as dip. Definitely plenty of food. In all it came out to be about 27 dollars, including tip.<br><br>Au Cheval deserves all the praise it gets, and is a true burger lover's paradise in the Windy City. While it will set you back a bit more than Shake Shack or In-N-Out, this is arguably one of the best examples of an up-scale burger you can find.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">According to my "Yelp stats" about 10 times as many people view my pics as my reviews.<br><br>So just do it: skip ahead and look at the pic of my FOIE GRAS &amp; SCRAMBLED EGGS. Click Like, vote Helpful, wipe the drool off your mobile device, and be off on your way.<br><br>For the other 10% of you that are still around, congrats on having an attention span that lasts longer than a Snapchat video! Oh, and thanks.<br><br>You'll have plenty of time to read more reviews while waiting for a table at Au Cheval, as it gets busy and they have a limited seating capacity. On a Saturday at about 12:30, we were quoted a 90+ minute wait (even at the bar), so we bailed quicker than Michael Strahan left Kelly Ripa on 'Live.' We came back for brunch the next day (Sunday), arrived a few minutes before opening, and scored a front row seat at the counter with a prime view of the food prep area.<br><br>They may be most known for their burgers. But, look at my pic again. One of the servers later told me he felt that it was their best entree, and I have to say it is the BEST USE OF FOIE GRAS EVER! Combined with fluffy eggs, this is a bold dish with rich flavors and a silky texture. Simply outstanding all around, and probably enough to get you to forget about those burgers. It comes with a plate of Texas Toast as well. <br><br>Because I couldn't imagine ordering something like milk or orange juice at a bar like this, I decided to get one of their breakfast beers: Solemn Oath's enticingly named "Punk Rock for Rich Kids," which is a Belgian Pale Ale. Perhaps my taste buds were still on West Coast time and it was a little too early for beer, as I only moderately enjoyed it. When it comes to the Foie Gras and Scrambled Eggs though, I'd be up for it any time of the day, and twice on Sunday.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">This is my favorite burger place in Chicago! Definitely #1 in my list! Both times that I've been here, I got a table right away and didn't wait at all. The first time I went as a party of 2 and the 2nd time, I went with a party of 4 and we were seated right away. The key is to go on a weekday during off peak hours like 2pm. I ordered a cocktail while waiting for my burger and fries. The Punch #3 (gin, pineapple, and amaretto) was yummy. <br><br>As for the main course, I ordered the single cheeseburger (a single actually has 2 patties) topped with an egg and the fries with garlic aioli sauce. Let me tell you that as a burger person, I am super picky with my burgers. The burger has to be juicy and it cannot be dripping with grease. Au Cheval passed my test and earned its personal #1 spot in my belly. The burger was juicy and not dripping with grease. The fries were a perfect crisp and the garlic aioli sauce was the perfect accompaniment to the fries. There's a reason why this place has long lines and why it's on multiple best burger lists. Go here, it's worth the hype!</br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">I've heard about this place and we knew that we had to show up early.<br><br>On a Saturday morning, we showed up at 10:15AM and there was already a line forming outside the building. \xa0Promptly at 11 AM, the doors were open and we were seated. \xa0**WARNING-seating is tight in there** \xa0We were given a brunch menu and I was really worried that their famous Au Chevel burger wasn't on there. \xa0However, there it was!<br><br>My hubby and I ordered the Fries with Mornay Sauce, Garlic Aioli, and Fried Farm Egg and each an Au Chavel burger.<br><br>The fries were cooked perfectly and oh my..that aioli was excellent. \xa0The egg was a good addition to the fries. \xa0Now, the burger...we ordered the single burger and it came with two patties. \xa0We were a little shocked by that. \xa0However, the burger itself was delicious. \xa0When you slap the two halves together and get the yolk to ooze all over the burger....totally worth it.<br><br>I have to admit that this was a LOT of food just for me and I couldn't finish it (I also had a hangover from a late night out the night before). \xa0<br><br>Show up early and get ready to eat some good food.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">2800+ reviews and counting and today is the first time I ate at Au Cheval! Fortunately, it's a Monday afternoon at 2:30p and although the restaurant has been consistently packed, we didn't have to wait at all to get seated. <br><br>We got 2 cocktails, the single burger with egg, Jane's chicken and a green salad. <br><br>Did it live up to the hype?? ABSOLUTELY! <br>Is it the best burger I've eaten? PROBABLY NOT! Will I return? ABSOLUTELY! \xa0<br><br>I hope this summarizes our experience and makes it easier for you to make the effort and get out here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Okay. Let's get something straight right off the bat. I have never, nor will I ever, be one that is too keen on "the hype." Whenever some place gets dubbed as "the best..." or "the greatest" or "the hottest" I always subconsciously side-eye the person who has classified said hype as such. Not to sound too hipster-who-hates-anything-mainstream. With that said, I can truthfully say that this IS the best burger I have had in Chicago.<br><br>Up until 5/5/2016 the tastiest burger I have had in the city was from 25 Degrees. Im not sure what kind of voodoo magic these chefs are practicing behind that darned counter, but whatever they're brewing/selling, I'm buying. RIP to my wallet (and to my time waiting to get a spot at this diner).<br><br>Speaking of which, as far as diners go, Au Cheval sits in an entirely superior realm. The decor matches the industrial aesthetic of West Loop: exposed brick, piping in the ceiling, steel bar counters, iron bar stools, leather tufted bar seating, wood tabletops: its very speakeasy like and I am totally here for it.<br><br>Let's also talk about the wait time. I absolutely cannot stand the reviewers here and on Facebook that dock a point because they had to stand and wait and SOCIALIZE WITH THEIR PARTY before they got a seat. Its ridiculous. We waited 45 minutes solid for 2 first come first served bar spots. Honestly, this is the way to go. The service here is pretty spotty but quite frankly I expected that when I entered the extremely small space and noticed how packed it was and how busy/loud/obnoxious the entire environment was. Anyone expecting 5star customer service under these circumstances are plain idiots. <br><br>Now lets get to this food.<br><br>I ordered the single cheeseburger with thick cut bacon, and the crispy fries with garlic aioli, mornay sauce, and fried egg. When my plate came I bout cried. It was the most beautiful food I had seen in a while. I had worked up quite an appetite due to the wait and not having lunch so I quickly prepared the sandwich How I liked it and started my engine(s). First, I took the egg from the fries and put it on the burger. Once stacked, I cut in half and had an orgasm watching the egg run. <br><br>My first bite...listen. I can't even explain it. This burger has earned its reputation. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. The bacon, which I think are actually pork belly strips, offered just the right amount of peppery/maplely/smokeness to the sour pickles, creamy egg, and superbly seasoned burger. I only ate half in the diner so that I could relive the moment just a few more at home.<br><br>The fries. THE FRIES. I devoured all of these. The mornay sauce is SO good: thick, creamy, cheesy, and paired with the aioli...its a sinful indulgence that SHOULD BE ILLEGAL! Its just not right to do this to people, man! To know that I waited 11 months and 45 minutes to trek west to Au Cheval is quite disappointing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Seeing the reviews on yelp and travel groups I'm belong to, I just knew this place was somewhere I had to try. So, twice, in the time span of a month, two friends and myself try to get in here to eat, we were deflated to see there was, quite obviously, a ridiculous wait. How ridiculous you say? Let's try 2 or 3 hrs ridiculous. I know right...for a burger??<br><br>So, when someone tells me that they are going to be in town and available for dinner on a Monday, I immediately devise a plan for us to get in here without having to wait life's duration to sit down. "So, if you go at like 4:30 to put your name on the list, we could be sitting down by the time I get there". Needless to say, this little plan worked. Name was put on said list at about 5:15 we were seated once our entire party arrived, about 6:15.... ON. A. MONDAY! I've been wanting a really good burger for a while, and I was extremely excited about this one. We peruse the menu, I know exactly what I'm getting, the "single" burger which isn't a single at all, but a double patty burger and the "double" is actually a triple patty burger. Like, what in the world is going on?? Ya'll trying to confuse me, eh?? #notcanadian<br><br>*PLOT TWIST* There's a vegetarian at the table. The waitress asked if there was a vegetarian, \xa0and then proceeds to tell us EVERYTHING on the menu that's fried is fried in either pork or duck fat "not sure if that makes a difference" HELLS YEAH IT DOES! \xa0HELLOOOOOO. Come closer... I don't eat things that come from those animals. So, needless to say, I'm deflated. I can't have a burger, I can't have fries and the option to not make the burger in pork fat is not an option (we asked). The only option is the swine. So, as I sit here, and evaluate my life, glancing at the menu to see that the waitress has highlighted 99% of the menu items to contain pork or duck, I'm wonder what is the vanity of this life #ecclesiastes<br><br>Ohh, but ah ha! That 99% ain't 100! As I take a second peak at the menu, I noticed they had roasted bone marrow. No, they didn't. They had "Roasted Bone marrow, toast and beef cheek marmalade". Beef cheek marmalade?? Why for come ya'll tempt me so with this meaty jelly jam?? So, I went ahead and got that. I have to say, it was an AMAZING dish. Super rich. As I devoured that bone marrow greasy goodness, I felt my blood pressure increasing by the minute. It was everything that I will never know if that burger was. I had a drink as well. It was pretty solid.<br><br>I'm giving this place a solid 3 stars because of the lack of variety on their menu. If you're going to have a beef burger, that's what it should be. If you're going to have fries...from potatoes...yeah... I imagine the burgers are phenomenal, but that's not something I will ever know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">One of the most amazing burgers/meals I've ever had!<br><br>My boyfriend and I came in around Sunday at noon and were told it would be a 1.5-2 hour wait. BUT, the first 6 seats at the bar are first come, first served and we were so lucky to grab an open seat (we had to wait another ~15 minutes waiting for a second chair, but we didn't mind!).<br><br>FOOD:<br>cheeseburger \xe1 cheval ($12): that thick slice of bacon, oh geez.<br>foie gras &amp; scrambled eggs ($18): my favorite dish.. extremely flavorful and the combined ingredients are a match made in heaven. paired perfectly with toast, which also was so good on its own.<br>fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli &amp; fried farm egg ($10): yum, get this too.<br><br>The chefs at Au Cheval have put so much thought into their dishes; literally everything here will WOW you. Even though I didn't have to wait 1.5 hours, I very definitely would if I had to. <br><br>NOTE: If you're sitting in those first 6 seats, please be mindful of others who are waiting on you. I sat beside a couple who just sat there for half an hour chatting away with uneaten half-burgers on their plate. During this time, the seats to the left of us rotated twice..</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">I came here with a friend, we ordered bone marrow, foie gras, and double cheeseburger. I really liked the bone marrow, they are just oily enough to taste good without making you feel sick. The double cheeseburger were not actually double, there were three patties! We asked for bacon and egg on top, definitely worth it. The foie gras was actually recommended by our waitress, but I found it just ok, not comparable to the other two. Frankly speaking, I think their food is delicious but kinda overrated. Still they are worth five stars!</p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">I'll try to keep this short and sweet: <br><br>1) there's inevitably going to be a wait for this place as it's pretty tiny inside BUT it's well worth the wait<br>2) the single cheeseburger has 2 patties and the double cheeseburger is actually 3 patties... The single would definitely be enough <br>3) must try the crispy hashbrowns with duck heart gravy! It's so rich and flavorful<br>4) end the meal with a root beer float! It'll balance out all the salt and fat you just gorged yourself with. You won't regret it!<br><br>So happy to have finally tried this place!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">SO MUCH HYPE. I tried this place TWICE.<br><br>First time I went on a Saturday afternoon (around noon, stupidly enough) &amp; waited 2+ hours for a table for 2. Got so drunk off drinks at one of the (many) bars on this strip of restaurants that I barely remembered the burger. I thought the booze was impacting my taste buds..<br><br>Second time went on a Wednesday afternoon after 1pm with a group of 8 &amp; got seated RIGHT AWAY. That's the move. So, giving credit where credit is due.. BEST BLOODY MARY EVER. They put sweet pickles in it &amp; it was the best thing ever. Hands down best best BEST bloody mary. The only reason I gave 3 stars vs. 2 was for the bloody mary. I would actually go back &amp; wait in line for the bloody mary. Holy shit, it was so good..<br><br>When it comes to the entrees/burgers, meh. The french fries-- fine. But if you're a burger joint that fucks up french fries, you got bigger probs. The regular fries were not memorable but the fries + garlic aioli = good. Aioli is really good but it's garlic + mayo so I don't see a lot of ways that can go wrong either. The duck confit hash was soo whatevers that no one at our table ate it. <br><br>When it comes to the burger.. I got it with the bacon AND the egg which might have made it even heavier than usual but that's how it's recommended, right?! It's very messy. Prohibitively so. It squeezes out everywhere so you mash down the bread to fit it in your hands &amp; mouth &amp; it becomes a big, mushy pile of meat &amp; cheese. Love me some bacon but the kind here is too thick for me personally. Also, there are no greens at all! The burgers are too thick, too heavy, too meaty. <br><br>I dunno. Maybe I need to go back a third time to try the burger without the bacon or the egg.. Bread &amp; meat is a good combo right? Would go back for the Bloody Mary for sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">The cheeseburger....oh my (expletive!) I LOVE Au Cheval. It's dark, hip and feels enjoyably exclusive. Everything on the menu is mouthwatering. Expect to wait.....there's always a wait......it's worth the wait!! The house-made bologna sandwich is unbelievable. I could comfortably say the same for every item on the menu. \xa0I've never been let down by the creative cocktails either. Go to Au Cheval (and wait) as often as you can!</p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Oh my! I wish I ate this the first day I arrived Chicago so I could eat it once more before I leave! My best friend has been raving about this place and we finally had the chance to go! I'd say this is one of the best gourmet burgers I've tried! The venue itself is quite small and there is usually a line (from what my bestfriend told me).<br><br>For two, this is what we ordered:<br>*Single cheese burger $10.95 - We added egg and bacon with the burger. So delicious! We asked them for an extra pickle since we wanted our own! Y<br><br>*Crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy $9.95 - comes with egg on top. This dish was a bit of a a disappointment. Was very heavy too...<br><br>Beers that we ordered:<br>Seven flowers Ale syndicate $6 <br>Double IPA Brewer with 7 different hopes 8.1%<br><br>Centennial iPa founders $6<br>Midwestern iOS featuring centennial hops 7.2%</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">People consider it the best burger in Chicago. \xa0It's pretty darned good but the other food is good here too. \xa0Prepare to wait. \xa0I have never been here when it hasn't been jammed.</p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Best Burger Ever. <br>That is all.</br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Au Cheval definitely lives up to its reputation. We stopped in right at 5 pm to ensure we secured a table. We were victorious. We we're promptly seated in a spacious booth. We were served water and were soon greeted by our server and ordered drinks. We went with a Bloody Mary, Rare Vos Ommegang, and Prince Hall Virtue Cider. They drinks came out fairly quickly and followed up with our food order. 2 of us went with the single cheeseburger and topped the with the thick cut peppered bacon. I also went with the fried egg on top of mine. They don't ask you what temperature you want your burger at, but they come out perfectly. Served with a dill pickle spear. My other friend ordered the General Janes Honey Fried Chicken with chili, sesame, and cilantro. These were delicious, sticky, sticky, sweet, YUM! We also ordered the fries with come with a super tasty garlic aioli, smashed potatoes with roasted garlic gravy, and a side of their delicious bread and butter pickles. <br>The burgers are really simply delicious. Just a bit of chopped red onion, a well balanced dijonaise, two thin patties and two slices of cheese and super thinly sliced dill pickles. The addition of bacon and egg really adds a punch of favor and elevation to this delicious burger on its lightly toasted brioche bun. <br>The fries were hot and crisp and the garlic aioli were great as were the smashed potatoes. The bread and butter pickles were sooooo delicious. I love pickles. These were definitely the best bread and butter pickles I've ever had. <br>It was definitely worth the visit and we will be back!</br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">I totally don't get it. \xa0I mean, it was a fine burger, but I've (often) had better. \xa0we went very early, so we didn't have to wait, and it's a fun scene, good people-watching, nice drinks, good service. \xa0But to wait two hours for this is bizarre. \xa0It's just <br>not that good - it's an adequate burger.</br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">I am not a Chicago native but I do know my way around a burger. If you're looking to ruin every single burger experience you've ever had and for the rest of your life then this is the place to go. I don't know if I can express in words how wonderfully crafted this burger was made. Topped off with an egg and thickly sliced succulent bacon, with the bun smothered in some sort of rich creamy yet light sauce this burger may have been the definition of perfection. I truly believed from the bottom of my heart that Duke's Grocery in D.C. and their 'Proper Burger' was the best burger of my life, until I met Au Cheval. <br><br>I have heard the wait for these burgers were hours long. Arriving at 11:30 AM on a Monday, to put down my name for a reservation, I expected to be eating at or near 1:30 PM. I guess I was extremely lucky because I received a phone call within 30 minutes that my seat was ready for my friend and I. Being sat at the bar (where they prepare all the food for you beautiful eyes to see) I could do nothing but sip on my beer and drool while I wait for my food. The only negative part of sitting at the bar is that it does get a bit warm (which I expected as the grill is right there). The environment is very hipstery and just down to earth. You won't be seeing anything but wholesome goodness at this restaurant. I loved the servers and they allowed me to taste test the beers I've never tried before. I honestly can't think of one negative thing to say about Au Cheval. There's my two cents.</br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Believe it or not! Au Ceval has the best Omelet in ChiTown. Not only look different but it tastes different than other omelette I had from somewhere else. Simple ingredients : Oyster mushroom, Kale and Morel jack cheese and maybe with their miracle secrete, my Omelet was something to die for, it was fluffy, buttery and so delicious. Great price for just 10.95 <br><br>My friend had burger and it was so good. they served with their chunky cut fries, yummy! Last time I had the Au Cheval single burger with egg, It brew my mind away. <br><br>Along with my favorite drink from their menu, Flapper : (Au Cheval Modern) Martin miller's gin, pepper, lemon, honey and fernet $12 This drinks is great and delightful. I wish I could keep drinking and never get drunk ( I have my limit) LOL<br><br>Fun to watch them cook and prepare your meal. As much as I like watching cooking channels, this is much more fun and exciting, it's LIVE right in front of you if you sit at the bar ,which I love. If I could I would request sitting there when return.<br><br>If you have to wait for an hour or longer, please do and don't complain, this place is worth the wait, for the quality that you will experience with them, food, drink, service and \xa0good vibes. I never walk in there with no long waiting line ( not even mention weekend) \xa0It proves everything they do at Au Cheval, excellent!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">I guess I should have remembered that I'm from Texas. Claimed "Amazing" steak or burgers from any other states have to be taken with caution. <br><br>So our server at a rooftop bar recommended this place. Claimed as the "best burger in the nation", that says a LOT, right?<br><br>I just want to say that I really loved the atmosphere, ambiance, music, and service was great! <br><br>buttttt. The burger was GOOD. Would I say it's the best burger i've "ever" had? No...<br>I would put it below Hopdoddy's (a Texas native) and Five Guys forsure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Burger with bacon- AMAZING!! <br><br>Wait- Long but worth it. We went to Haymarket across the street, drank a few dozen beer samples while we waited. Saw a movie, built a house, had a baby, THEN we got the call saying our table was ready but it was worth it. Haha. <br><br>Bloody Mary- Not the best I've had. Still drank it though. <br><br>We waited about 3 hours for a table for two but we did our research so that was expected. We went home for an hour and drank beer samples at Haymarket for another hour and half so it wasn't bad at all. <br><br>As everyone here mentioned, If you order a single you get a double. A double is a triple. Bacon was perfect. Atmosphere was great. Nice spot to go to every once and a while but not all the time. I'm a burger gal, I can't wait 3+ hours for a burger. <br><br>Loved it! Will be checking out Small Cheval in Wicker Park soon!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Came in just before closing and the place was still packed with a 2 hour wait. The host was kind enough to steal us two bar stools just as we were walking out and giving up... So thankful and happy he did that for us. Our burger and fried chicken were absolutely amazing, as always. Au Cheval is always #1 in our hearts, and the effort for a seat is always worth it. You guys are the best.</p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">I've been wanting to try this burger but haven't wanted to put up with the wait. Went around 5:45 on a Wednesday and got seated within 10 minutes...Win! <br>Burger lived up to the hype. Had the single with bacon. So big I couldn't eat it all but no regrets. The thick bacon really makes it. Also had the fries with an egg on top ( love the dipping sauces they serve it with). Also got the pickles which were good but if probably go with a different side next time. <br>I like how they have a lot of beers on tap but they're more boutique style beers. <br>Can't wait to come back and try some of the other menu items!</br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">The burgers are fabulous, and the fries with garlic aioli are addictive. But let me tell you about two other amazing things: their sesame wings and the OMG fabulous 32 oz. pork porterhouse with foie gras &amp; roasted apples. They were heavenly. <br><br>We had a tremendously hungry family date last Friday and put in our names at 5-ish PM. We went across the street to Haymarket Pub for a few drinks and were seated in 45 minutes. Our starving bunch had an order of wings for an appetizer and they were sweet and sticky and perfectly fried. They brought us hot towels to clean up (classy!). Then we shared their fantastic burgers and the porterhouse. We divided the leftovers and our half of the porterhouse produced two rich and tender meals later on. Can't wait to go back. <br><br>P.S. This is a great neighborhood to walk off a big meal on a beautiful summer night.</br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Best burger in Chicago. This is generally agreed upon by everyone I know in Chicago. Two important steps to know when you stop in:<br><br>1) Get a single. A single is two patties, a double is three.<br>2) Get bacon on it. And an egg. JUST DO IT.<br><br>Now go...</br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">Great burger, interminable wait times, and a fun crowd sum up this place to me.<br><br>I'd heard about Au Cheval from multiple friends who described the burger in reverential terms, but warned about wait times that can stretch more than 2 hours. \xa0On a Saturday early afternoon, we were quoted 2-2.5 hours, and informed that there were 37 groups ahead of us. \xa0Apparently that day there were already more people in line than seats in the entire place at the time they opened the doors. \xa0The host kindly suggested that we try to arrive before opening on Sunday, and when we did so, we had no trouble getting in. \xa0Thanks for the tip!<br><br>Au Cheval is fairly simple on the inside, classic gastropub type of feel. \xa0For our Sunday brunch we enjoyed some excellent Bloody Mary's, a burger per person, which lived up to the hype, fries loaded with cheese, and the foie gras scrambled egg. \xa0All were superb, although I'm not sure if it's worth waiting 2 hours for these items. \xa0Service was adequate, but by no means stellar. \xa0Prices were very reasonable given the quality of food.<br><br>I'd love to try some of their other items on a future visit, but I feel like it's hard to not get the burger at Au Cheval. \xa0The only thing that would make the place better is the ability to make a reservation, but given the success that they're already enjoying, I doubt they'll tinker with a winning concept.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>, <p itemprop="description" lang="en">I'll keep it short I think. Visited Chitown for the first time. During my research prior to the trip, all the lists that I saw on the internet and from what Mr Bourdain suggested that there was no way I couldn't go without trying Cheval.<br><br>Had the best bone marrow I have ever had in my life here - love how they roast it (also love them giving us extra toast for it). \xa0<br><br>Of course the hype on the cheeseburgers was true - the burger patty was juicy and tasted freshly handmade, even the pickles were delish. Also, you have to ADD BACON to your burgers - just listen and do it! <br><br>Staff is extremely friendly and helpful -made us feel at home!</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>]
